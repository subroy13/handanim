# ✍️ handanim

[![Build and Deploy Docs](https://github.com/subroy13/handanim/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/subroy13/handanim/actions/workflows/docs.yml)

> A Python library to create whiteboard-style, hand-drawn animations for educational videos, tutorials or data storytelling.

**handanim** lets you programmatically animate hand-drawn diagrams, geometric shapes, handwritten text, and visual explanations — ideal for online teaching, explainer videos, and mathematical illustrations.

> ⭐️ If you like this project, please consider starring it on [GitHub](https://github.com/subroy13/handanim)! Your support helps the project grow.

## ✨ Features

- Draw and animate shapes (lines, ellipses, polygons) with a hand-drawn feel
- Fill objects with sketch-style strokes (hatching, scribbles)
- Animate handwritten text using custom fonts
- Export vector images (SVG) or videos (MP4).
- Intuitive Python API for creating scenes and timelines

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 📦 Installation using Poetry

The easiest way to install all the dependencies is to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires Python 3.11+)
poetry install

# Run example animation
poetry run python examples/pythagoras.py
```

### ✏️ Basic Usage

```python
from handanim.core import Scene
from handanim.animations import SketchAnimation
from handanim.primitives import NGon

scene = Scene(width = 800, height = 608)
triangle = NGon(
    center = (400, 304),
    radius = 100,
    n = 3
)
scene.add(SketchAnimation(start_time = 0, end_time = 5), drawable = triangle)
scene.render("triangle_anim.mp4", fps = 30)
```

## 📦 Installation using pip

If you prefer using `pip` instead of Poetry, you can install the main dependencies directly from the `requirements.txt` file. This method works well for lightweight setups or deployment environments.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install development dependencies
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

# Run example animation
python examples/pythagoras.py
```

Make sure you're using Python 3.11+ (as specified in the project). 

## 📦 Installation using conda

If you prefer conda for environment management:

```bash
# Create a new environment
conda create -n handanim python=3.11
conda activate handanim

# Install system dependencies via conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge cairo pycairo ffmpeg

# Install handanim and remaining Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run example animation
python examples/pythagoras.py
```

> **Note:** The `requirements.txt` may need updating for your platform. If you encounter issues, the Poetry-based installation is the most tested path.

## Installing Cairo 

Your system must have the Cairo graphics library installed for `pycairo` or `cairocffi` to work correctly. This is a native C library and needs to be installed separately depending on your OS.

#### ✅ On Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcairo2 libcairo2-dev
```

#### ✅ On macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
brew install cairo
```

#### ✅ On Windows
Use the precompiled binaries:

1. Download the [GTK 3 Runtime](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases) (which includes Cairo).
2. Install it and add its bin/ folder to your system PATH.
3. Then install Python packages as usual:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use the cairocffi + pycairo + pip combo with wheels from [Gohlke's unofficial site](https://www.cgohlke.com/#pycairo) if needed.


## 🎬 Installing FFmpeg (Required for Video Rendering)

`moviepy` uses FFmpeg to write video files (e.g., .mp4). You must have FFmpeg installed and accessible in your system PATH.

#### ✅ On Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### ✅ On macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### ✅ On Windows

1. Download FFmpeg from the [official site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or a reliable Windows build like [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
2. Extract the archive, and add the bin/ folder to your system PATH.
3. Verify installation:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```
