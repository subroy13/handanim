# ‚úçÔ∏è handanim

[![Build and Deploy Docs](https://github.com/subroy13/handanim/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/subroy13/handanim/actions/workflows/docs.yml)

> A Python library to create whiteboard-style, hand-drawn animations for educational videos, tutorials or data storytelling.

**handanim** lets you programmatically animate hand-drawn diagrams, geometric shapes, handwritten text, and visual explanations ‚Äî ideal for online teaching, explainer videos, and mathematical illustrations.

> ‚≠êÔ∏è If you like this project, please consider starring it on [GitHub](https://github.com/subroy13/handanim)! Your support helps the project grow.

## ‚ú® Features

- Draw and animate shapes (lines, ellipses, polygons) with a hand-drawn feel
- Fill objects with sketch-style strokes (hatching, scribbles)
- Animate handwritten text using custom fonts
- Export vector images (SVG) or videos (MP4).
- Intuitive Python API for creating scenes and timelines

## üì∑ Example Output

### Example 1: Pythagoras Theorem

## üöÄ Quickstart

### üì¶ Installation using Poetry

The easiest way to install all the dependencies is to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires Python 3.13+)
poetry install

# Run example animation
poetry run python examples/pythagoras.py
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è Basic Usage

```python
from handanim.core import Scene
from handanim.animations import SketchAnimation
from handanim.primitives import NGon

scene = Scene(width = 800, height = 608)
triangle = NGon(
    center = (400, 304),
    radius = 100,
    n = 3
)
scene.add(SketchAnimation(start_time = 0, end_time = 5), drawable = triangle)
scene.render("triangle_anim.mp4", fps = 30)
```

## üì¶ Installation using pip

If you prefer using `pip` instead of Poetry, you can install the main dependencies directly from the `requirements.txt` file. This method works well for lightweight setups or deployment environments.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install development dependencies
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

# Run example animation
python examples/pythagoras.py
```

Make sure you're using Python 3.11+ (as specified in the project). 

## Installing Cairo 

Your system must have the Cairo graphics library installed for `pycairo` or `cairocffi` to work correctly. This is a native C library and needs to be installed separately depending on your OS.

#### ‚úÖ On Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcairo2 libcairo2-dev
```

#### ‚úÖ On macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
brew install cairo
```

#### ‚úÖ On Windows
Use the precompiled binaries:

1. Download the [GTK 3 Runtime](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases) (which includes Cairo).
2. Install it and add its bin/ folder to your system PATH.
3. Then install Python packages as usual:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use the cairocffi + pycairo + pip combo with wheels from [Gohlke's unofficial site](https://www.cgohlke.com/#pycairo) if needed.


## üé¨ Installing FFmpeg (Required for Video Rendering)

`moviepy` uses FFmpeg to write video files (e.g., .mp4). You must have FFmpeg installed and accessible in your system PATH.

#### ‚úÖ On Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### ‚úÖ On macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### ‚úÖ On Windows

1. Download FFmpeg from the [official site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or a reliable Windows build like [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
2. Extract the archive, and add the bin/ folder to your system PATH.
3. Verify installation:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

## üß† Internals (Architecture)

1. `core`: Core capabilities.

   - `drawable.py`: Defines the structure that can be drawn.
   - `styles.py`: Defines the styling oriented options that can be configured.
   - `draw_ops.py`: Defines the opsets, the basic structure that is used to draw. Along with the rendering logic for the opsset into the cairo context.
   - `utils.py`: Some utility functions that does not fit anywhere else
   - `animation.py`: Defines the animation structures.
   - `scene.py`: Defines the scene, which is the main entry point for the user.

2. Models.
   - `Ops` and `OpsSet`: Describe vector drawing instructions.
   - `Scene`: Collects objects and sequences them in time.
   - Handwriting: Converts strokes from mock or real fonts into draw operations.

## üí° Features Coming soon

1. Arrows
2. Flowcharts diagrams
3. Importing images and videos into the scene.
4. Autofitting content based on the size of textbox
5. Showcasing tabular data with headers.
